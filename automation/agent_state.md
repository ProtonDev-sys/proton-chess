# Proton Chess automation state

- Automation ID: `proton-human-strength`
- Goal: human-style, selectable-strength engine with a statistically significant match win over Stockfish at `UCI_Elo=3000`
- Last run: `2026-08-09T05:32:48+01:00`
- Status: `passed`
- Change kept: detect shallow quiet mate-in-one at the quiescence horizon
- Active branch: `agent/fix-quiet-mate-horizon`
- Base: `origin/main` at `835224a`

## Latest evidence

- Target FEN: `3r2k1/ppB2pp1/6b1/7p/1n1Pq3/2Q3P1/PP3P1P/2KR3R w - - 1 22`.
- Before the change, restricted `c3b4` at depth 1 scored `+617` in 2 nodes with PV `c3b4`; depth 2 found `c3b4 e4c2` as mate against Proton in 102 nodes.
- Quiescence now checks for an immediate legal quiet mate only within the first three plies. It returns the exact mate score and preserves the mating move in the TT and PV without adding general quiet-check recursion.
- After the change, the same restricted depth-1 search reports mate against Proton in 2 nodes with PV `c3b4 e4c2`.
- Exact pre/post depth-12 comparison kept identical node counts, scores, best moves, and PVs on all three fixtures:
  - startpos: `970427` nodes
  - Kiwipete: `551591` nodes
  - endgame: `253200` nodes
- Median aggregate benchmark time across three fresh processes was `1089 ms` before and `1076 ms` after. No slowdown claim is made from that small timing sample; it rules out the earlier broader scan's measurable overhead.
- A four-game paired fixed-movetime Stockfish-3000 smoke scored `0-4` both before and after. This is only a gross regression check; the current estimator cannot support a strength claim.
- Full canonical validation and CTest passed.
- No Elo improvement claim is made from the tactical correction.

## Previous run: UCI cancellation race

- Before the change, three independent eight-search transcripts containing `go infinite` followed immediately by `stop` all timed out.
- Root cause: the input thread could request a stop before the worker entered `Search::think`; the worker then cleared that request and searched indefinitely while the input thread blocked in `join()`.
- `Search::think` now offers an optional one-shot start callback immediately after its final stop-flag reset.
- The UCI layer waits for that callback before returning from `start_search`, so a following `stop` cannot be lost.
- The UCI smoke test now covers 16 immediate normal stops and four immediate ponder stops without waiting for search output first.
- After the change, the same three independent eight-search transcripts exited cleanly with 8/8 non-null best moves each.
- Final local validation passed:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build --config Release`
  - `ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure`
  - `python -m compileall python tools`
  - `python tools/check_perft.py build/Release/proton_chess.exe`
  - `python tools/crosscheck_movegen.py build/Release/proton_chess.exe --count 40 --plies 10 --seed 17`
  - `python tools/benchmark_uci.py build/Release/proton_chess.exe --depth 10 --json`
- Search and evaluation behavior are unchanged; no Elo claim is made.

## Previous run: validation baseline

- The 0.2.0 engine built successfully before the change and its two CTest tests passed.
- The canonical perft check initially failed because the validator had been removed and the engine now emits `info string perft depth ... nodes ...`.
- The canonical move-generation cross-check initially failed because the `moves` debug command had been removed; every tested position returned an empty engine move list.
- Restored `tools/check_perft.py`, `tools/crosscheck_movegen.py`, their curated positions, and the `python` tooling package.
- Restored the `moves` debug command without changing search or evaluation behavior.
- Added a Windows/Linux GitHub Actions validation workflow.
- Final local validation passed:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build --config Release`
  - `ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure`
  - `python -m compileall python tools`
  - `python tools/check_perft.py build/Release/proton_chess.exe`
  - `python tools/crosscheck_movegen.py build/Release/proton_chess.exe --count 40 --plies 10 --seed 17`
- Move-generation evidence: 49/49 positions matched python-chess, including 9 curated edge cases.
- No performance or strength claim is made from this validation-only change.

## Repository routing

- The original checkout contains pre-existing uncommitted legacy work and remains untouched.
- Active development uses a clean linked worktree so that work cannot be lost during the 0.2.0 architecture transition.

## Next target

- Establish the pinned Stockfish-3000 match protocol and a trustworthy 60+0.6 baseline on 0.2.0.
- Replace the estimator's invalid zero-variance confidence interval with pair-aware statistics and record complete match provenance.
- Repair the current human move selector and UCI Elo mapping before extending the advertised 2800 ceiling.
- Keep future engine changes only with focused regressions, canonical validation, and paired before/after strength evidence.
